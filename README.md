# Pollux's Neovim Configuration

This is my Neovim configuration, which I have uploaded here both for me to have
a backup and so others can possibly get inspiration from it.

To install, first move or delete any existing configuration, then:
```bash
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/polluxprograms/nvim.git
```
